    compute_semantic_coverage immediately after every matmul, before it's ever read. So

        SELECT_TOKENS(k) (§6.1), lazy-greedy variant: keeps one (possibly stale) gain bound
        per candidate in a max-heap. Submodularity (Proposition 1) guarantees a stale bound is
        always >= the candidate's true current gain, so recomputing only the heap's current top
        and comparing it against the next-best stale bound is enough to certify the true maximizer,
        without recomputing every remaining candidate at every iteration (unlike exact greedy).

        Before the loop starts, every candidate needs one *exact* initial gain to seed the heap
        (§6.1: "Initial gains are exact") -- this one-time pass is O(|candidates|) CANDIDATE_DELTA
        calls and is the dominant cost on a large graph (e.g. ~75k candidates), yet it produces no
        output on its own since nothing has been selected yet. progress_every prints a line every
        that many candidates scored (in both this phase and, further below, the greedy loop) so it
        doesn't look hung. n_jobs parallelizes exactly this initial scan across worker processes --
        each candidate's initial gain only depends on the fixed T/S at call time, so the scan is
        embarrassingly parallel. n_jobs=1 (default) runs it serially (no subprocess overhead, fine
        for small graphs); n_jobs=-1 uses all CPU cores. The lazy loop itself is left serial: with
        the observed ~1-7 re-evals per accepted token, IPC overhead would dominate any speedup there.

        If verbose, prints one line per selected token with:
          - its rank i/k, id, marginal gain, and cumulative score F_D(T_i);
          - re-evals: how many stale candidates had to be recomputed this round before the
            true maximizer was found (a lazy-greedy efficiency indicator -- 1 means the top
            of the heap was accepted immediately);
          - opt<=: an upper bound on the best score any T with |T| = i could reach, from the
            (1 - 1/e) guarantee (Eq. 5): since F_D(T_greedy_i) >= GREEDY_RATIO * OPT_i, we get
            OPT_i <= F_D(T_greedy_i) / GREEDY_RATIO. The guarantee holds at every prefix size,
            not just the final k, so this bound is meaningful after each token, not only at the end.
